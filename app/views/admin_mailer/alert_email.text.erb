Dear Coin-API Admin:

It's that time again! Coin machines in the system are running low (less than 4 coins total) of the following coin:

<%= @coin[:name].pluralize.camelcase(:upper) %>

Please note that we have only <%= Coin.where(name: @coin[:name]).count %> of this type of coin remaining. Please make additional coins available.

The total value of the coins in our system is currently <%= Coin.sum(:value) %>.

Thank you,
The Coin-API Team
